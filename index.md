I am a student currently undertaking my Masters in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, New York. I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT-Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India.

I am looking for an internship in the Summer of 2018, and have worked on Human Computer Interaction, Image Processing, Machine Learning and Computer Vision.


## Work Experience

**Tonbo Imaging, Bangalore, India** - FPGA and Embedded Design Engineer (May '15 - June '17)  
**Research Center Imarat, Hyderabad, India** - Intern (May '14 - July '15')


## Projects

### Image Segmentation Using SLIC Superpixels  
The aim of this project was to segment foreground and background in an image. The code uses two seeds from a user to denote a subset of superpixel clusters as foreground and background, and then applies Graph Cut to segment the image using superpixels as the nodes in a graph.

### Investigation To Find Fraud Using Enron Dataset
Experimented with various Machine Learning algorithms to accurately predict employees committing fraud using the Enron Financial and Email Dataset. Obtained approximately 84% accuracy using a Random Forests Model.
